This project focuses on the semantic segmentation of Mars terrain images, which is essential for auto- mated terrain analysis in planetary exploration and rover navigation. 
Each image is classified into one of five terrain classes: background, soil, bedrock, sand, and big rock. 
To enhance the modelâ€™s capability to generalize across diverse Martian landscapes, we train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using a labeled dataset and apply various preprocessing and augmentation techniques to diversify the data.
